# Dota 2.0 Network

Dota 2.0 is the first fully decentralized super blockchain network of the Polkadot ecosystem, jointly initiated by developers from the Polkadot and Ethereum communities, without any venture capital involvement. This network promotes fairness, freedom, and openness, embracing more radical technological innovations in the blockchain field. It will connect the ecosystems of Polkadot, Ethereum, TON, and Bitcoin, contributing to global financial integration and the development of blockchain technology. The aim is to establish the largest Web3 developer DAO in the world.

# Origin of Dota

The inception of Dota came from a group of loyal fans of the Dota game, who are also active developers and users within the Polkadot and Ethereum communities. It is the first inscription project of the Polkadot community and the worldâ€™s first inscription project to achieve average distribution within the block. This fair mechanism has been adopted by many subsequent inscription and rune projects. It created a historical transaction record on the Polkadot chain, adding approximately 260,000 DOT in revenue to the Polkadot treasury, while bringing over 10,000 new users to the Polkadot community, gaining widespread support in the Asian community. This community operates without whales or venture capital, and there is no pre-mining; the developers adhere to principles of freedom, fairness, and openness, with everyone contributing to its construction.

# Dota and Dota 2.0

The Dota 2.0 network is the outcome of the Dota community developers' easter plan. This marks a new beginning, expanding use cases through the construction of a superchain, allowing Dota 2.0 to unleash limitless possibilities in social, gaming, financial, and other fields. With rich on-chain governance, Dota 2.0 aims to better achieve community autonomy and complete decentralization.
